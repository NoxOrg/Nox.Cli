<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
***
Nox.Cli is a companion command-line tool that supports the core [Nox library](https://github.com/NoxOrg/Nox). Its *raison d'Ãªtre* is to build upon Nox's strong efficiency focus by extending that vision to the entire Enterprise Software Roadmap. This includes fast-tracking of DevOps functions like deployment to multiple environments, setting up CI/CD pipelines and configuring resource permissions. This is achieved by integrating seamlessly with existing enterprise assets and services like Helm charts, Azure KeyVault and Active Directory.

Nox.Cli is declarative in nature with the primary aim to describe a project or solution. It uses with a range of plugin technologies in the development, infrastructure and DevOps realms to rapidly configure and deploy a solution in the enterprise.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The section below will walk you though installation of the Nox.Cli tool as well as a sample project to illustrate how simple it is to set up set up the associated DevOps environment.
***
### Prerequisites
---

Make sure you have .NET 6 installed on your PC.
```powershell
PS> dotnet --version
6.0.404
```
### Install the Nox.Cli tool
---
The Nox.Cli tool is hosted on nuget.org [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nox.Cli) and additional installation options are detailed there. The recommended installation method is outlined below: -
```powershell
dotnet tool install --global Nox.Cli
```
Running the Nox.Cli tool installation with the global option yields the following output: -

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-install-clean.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
</div>

Running Nox.Cli for the first time yields the following output: -

```powershell
Nox
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-run-check-credentials.png" alt="Overview" width="100%">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

> ðŸ’¡ You may notice from the screenshot that if you are logged in to Azure it will automatically use these credentials. In the instance that you're not logged into Azure you will be redirected to Microsoft login screen in a browser: -

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/windows-login-selection.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

> ðŸ’¡ The second important thing to note is that apart from the `--version` and `--logout` commands, the additional commands listed above are dynamically added from the workflows folder in your local repository or from a script repository which is linked to your organisation, hosted at `https://noxorg.dev/workflows/{tenant.id}/index.php`

## Sample Project: Setting up a Simple Environment
---

The development project built for our [Nox](https://github.com/NoxOrg/Nox) sample was a [simple currency microservice](https://github.com/NoxOrg/Nox#creating-a-project) with all the expected CRUD endpoints to add & maintain the currencies of our choice. We're going to use the Nox.Cli companion tool to set up the entire DevOps environment that accompanies that project.

### Defining the Project

Running the `Nox new` command outlines its usage options as seen below: -

```powershell
Nox new
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-new.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Let's create a folder for our project and run the `Nox new service` command from within the newly created folder: -

```powershell
mkdir CurrencyConverter
cd .\CurrencyConverter\
Nox new service
```
A series of questions follows which will determine the initial configuration of our project environment. Upon completetion of the input, these options will be saved into the project configuration file called `{service.name}.service.nox.yaml`

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-new-input.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

```powershell
PS> ls
```

As we can see, the sercvice configuration file is now present in our default project directory. Opening this file in a code editor of your choice will reveal configuration options that echoes your input from the interactive step preceding this.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-directory-service-yaml.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

The YAML file is registered with [schema.org](https://schema.org/) so we get linting and auto-completion to ensure accuracy and speed in configuring our service. The schema used to describe our sample project can be viewed [here](https://noxorg.dev/schemas/NoxConfiguration.json).

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/vscode-service-yaml.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
</div>

### Commissioning the Environment

Now we have defined the project attributes but all we have is a simple YAML file, but no environment as yet. Well this is where the magic really starts. We'll turn our attention to the `Nox sync` command and its various options to read our project configuration file and set up the project environment as per our input.

```powershell
PS> Nox sync
```

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-sync.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
</div>

#### Version Control

This step will go and check the specified DevOps server and create our version control repository if not already present.
```powershell
PS> Nox sync version-control
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-sync-version-control.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Subsequent to running this command a cursory glance at our DevOps server will reveal the newly created project.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/dev-azure-com-projects.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

```powershell
PS> Nox sync azure-active-directory
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-sync-azure-active-directory.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

You'll notice that your project group have now been created on Azure Active Directory.
<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/portal-azure-com-group-overview.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

If you click on the Members link of the group you'll seet that the users are as per your earlier project configuration.
<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/portal-azure-com-group-members.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

```powershell
PS> Nox sync database
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-sync-database.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

```powershell
PS> Nox sync helm-chart
```
<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-sync-helm-chart.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Having a look at your project on the DevOps server will reveal that the Helm Chart repo have been created.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/dev-azure-com-repos-helm-chart.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

And selecting the `App.Helmchart` repo will show the relevant files.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/dev-azure-com-repos-helm-chart-detail.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
</div>

## Anatomy of a Manifest file

The manifest file is tasked with propogating the enterpriseâ€“level configurations related to our project. It is hosted in a tenant-specific folder on the Nox website and would typically be maintained by the DevOps team.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/vscode-manifest-yaml.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Firstly, the `secrets:` section is where we link to our secrets provider and vault url.

The `branches:` section is where we specify the command 'categories'â€”for the lack of a more techâ€“propriate term.
You'll recall from running the `Nox` command previously that it listed the `new`, `sync` and `version` commands as options. We'll disregard the `logout` command for now as it's baked into the tool. You will however see how these three commands have been propogated from the manfiest file.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/vscode-new-service.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Reviewing the various workflow yaml files will show how commands and their aliases are linked to the branches, outlined above. In the `NewNoxService.workflow.nox.yaml` example above, we can see how the `service` command, the `sv` alias and `|sv - Creates a new NOX app/service` description is linked to the `new` branch.

Further examination of the file will also reveal the various steps performed as part of the workflow.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-new-service-highlighted.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Similarly, in the `SyncDatabaseScript.workflow.nox.yaml` example below, we can see how the `database` command, the `db` alias and `|db - Ensures hosted database and roles exist for your NOX definition` description is linked to the `sync` branch.

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/vscode-sync-database.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

And the output when running the `Nox sync` command without any arguments reflect this: -

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/nox-cli-sync-database-highlighted.png" alt="Overview">
    <br/>
    <br/>
</div>

Finally, the `remote-task-proxy:` section points to the url and authorisationâ€“provide for the remote task executor which will conver in more detail later.

* Nox was inspired and draws heavily from [Paul DeVito](https://github.com/pdevito3)'s very impressive [Wrapt](https://wrapt.dev/) project. Nox is essentially (a less feature-rich) Wrapt without the code generation and aims to keep developer code 100% separate from the framework, and imposes no constraints on application architechture.
* Nox would not have been possible without the many open-source projects that it draws from. The goal is to build on top of an already rich ecosystem of great libraries and tools like Microsoft's .NetCore, YamlDotNet, NewtonSoft.Json, Hangfire, Serilog, SqlKata, ETLBox, Entity Framework, MassTransit and others.
